            <h3>Description of badminton</h3>
            <p>
                Badminton is a fast-paced racquet sport that can be played individually or in pairs. The objective is to hit a shuttlecock over a high net and land it in the opponent's court. The game combines elements of agility, strategy, and precision, requiring players to execute quick reflexes and well-timed shots.
                Courts are typically rectangular, with a net suspended in the middle, and players can score points by outmaneuvering their opponents and placing the shuttlecock in difficult-to-reach areas. The shuttlecock itself, often made of feathers or synthetic materials, has a unique flight pattern that demands skillful handling.
                Badminton is not only a competitive sport but also a popular recreational activity enjoyed around the world, promoting fitness, coordination, and social interaction. Whether played casually in a backyard or at a professional level, badminton offers excitement and a dynamic challenge for players of all ages.
